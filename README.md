Fornebu Makerspace Rules

## General Rules

* Ask someone for help if you don’t know how to use the equipment. Or
  request/join a course.
* Be careful with the equipment.
* If you break something because you didn’t read the manual - you repair/replace
  it
* Clean up when you leave
  * Throw garbage - electrical disposal by the elevators
  * Put equipment back to its place
  * Don’t leave your stuff in the makerspace. We have some small boxes to leave
    in the room. If you aren’t in the room, or stuff isn’t in the box, it can be
    thrown out.
* Don’t touch others stuff
* Use available safety equipment
* Ask an organizer before borrowing equipment from the makerspace
  (slack/e-mail). Deliver it back as soon as you don’t use it - at least before
  you leave work that day. Also write what you’ve borrowed, your name and phone
  number on the whiteboard, so others know where it is.
* Use of makerspace is for Telenor or personal use
  * Telenor IoT partners/customers may borrow the makerspace
  * Not for other business projects
  * If there’s conflict/high demand for equipment, a booking system will be
    established. Generally, work projects have priority during work hours.

## Equipment rules

* Turn off the equipment when you’re done
  * Really important for soldering station, rework station and other equipment
    that can start a fire if left on!
* 3D printers
  * Never turn off the printer when it’s heated up. Always push the reset button
    if you need to abort or heat it down. Otherwise plastic around the hotend
    will melt.
  * Stay in the lab for at least the first layer when starting a 3d print. Stop
    by often to check that the print hasn’t failed.
  * Don’t leave the print bed full of glue mess - clean it
  * Clean up extra pieces of plastic around the printer
* Logic analyzer
  * Digital input max -25.00V/+25.00V
  * Analog input max -10V/+10V
* Oscilloscope
  * Maximum input voltage of the analog channel CAT I 300 Vrms, CAT II 100 Vrms,
    transient overvoltage 1000 Vpk
